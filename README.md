This project was refactoring an existing page to make it more accesible. I added a descriptive title, and changed all divs to either header/article/aside/footer to better describe the content of the page. I gave all images an alt description, including an aria label for the background image. I fixed the navbar so all links navigate to their assigned section. Everything I changed in the index.html and style.css file has a comment.
